# Login-screen-to-chatroom
This is a login screen to a chatroom. At the login screen can you either login, register or obtain a lost password.

Within this project you have two additional files needed other then the main file(chatroom_encryption.py) one of which is "encryption_function_for_chatroom.py".
This file contains all the function needed to encrypt the password and generating a key to be used in get a forgotten password. 
A .txt-file is also needed were userinfo is stored.
Both the .txt-file and "encryption_function_for_chatroom.py" should perferebly be stored in the same dirctery as the main file. Tough this could generate problems  due to the files not being in the right directery and could not be found.
The .txt-file can you create yourself and insert at the given spot within the code.
